Below is a proposed *Scope of Features* for a Hackathon prototype to address inefficiencies in South Africa’s public healthcare system, focusing on connecting healthcare professionals and streamlining patient data management. The scope is designed to be feasible for a Hackathon, showcasing a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that demonstrates core capabilities.

# Hackathon Prototype: Scope of Features

## Project Title
Hybrid Healthcare Connection and Data Management Platform

## Objective
Develop a prototype that connects young and experienced healthcare professionals and streamlines patient data management to improve efficiency and collaboration in South Africa’s public healthcare system.

## Target Scope
Create an MVP with core features to demonstrate workforce engagement and patient data management, optimized for low-connectivity environments and user-friendly design.

## Proposed Features
### 1. Workforce Connection Module
- *User Registration*:
  - Simple sign-up for young nurses/doctors (seeking jobs/practicals) and experienced doctors (for volunteering/mentorship).
  - Fields: Name, role (nurse/doctor), qualifications, location, availability, preference (in-person/remote).
- *Opportunity Matching*:
  - Basic algorithm to match young professionals with job/practical opportunities and experienced doctors with mentorship/volunteer roles based on location and skills.
  - Display matches in a simple list with filters (e.g., location, role).
- *Communication Tool*:
  - Basic chat interface for users to connect (e.g., young nurse to mentor doctor).
  - Optional: Mock-up of a scheduling feature for mentorship sessions.
- *Volunteer Incentives*:
  - Feature to highlight remote volunteering options for experienced doctors (e.g., virtual consultations or mentorship).

### 2. Patient Data Management Module
- *Patient Record Creation*:
  - Form to input basic patient data (name, ID, medical history, current condition).
  - Offline storage capability (local database on device).
- *Data Access*:
  - Searchable patient records by ID or name, with a simple view of medical history.
  - Role-based access (e.g., doctor vs. nurse) with mock authentication (username/password).
- *Offline Sync*:
  - Store data locally when offline, with a “sync” button to upload to a central database when internet is available.
  - Mock cloud database (e.g., using Firebase or SQLite for demo purposes).
- *Basic EHR Template*:
  - Standardized fields for diagnoses and treatments to reduce repetitive admin tasks.

### 3. System Features
- *Mobile-Friendly Interface*:
  - Responsive design for smartphones (primary access for healthcare workers).
  - Simple, intuitive UI requiring minimal training.
- *Offline Functionality*:
  - Core features (record creation, viewing, and matching) work without internet.
  - Sync indicator to show when data is queued for upload.
- *Dashboard*:
  - Basic overview for admins showing number of users, matches made, and records created.
  - Mock analytics (e.g., “10 nurses matched” or “50 records saved”).

## Technical Scope
- *Frontend*: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (e.g., React or Vue.js for rapid prototyping).
- *Backend*: Lightweight server (e.g., Node.js, Flask) with a simple database (e.g., SQLite for offline, Firebase for cloud).
- *Offline Support*: Use local storage (e.g., IndexedDB or localForage) for offline data handling.
- *Security*: Basic encryption for data storage and mock user authentication.
- *Deployment*: Local demo or hosted on a free platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).

## Constraints
- *Time*: Hackathon duration (e.g., 24-48 hours), prioritizing core features.
- *Resources*: Limited to open-source tools and free hosting services.
- *Connectivity*: Prototype must simulate low/no internet functionality.
- *Scope Limitation*: Focus on 1-2 facilities’ worth of data/users for demo (e.g., 10 users, 50 patient records).

## Deliverables for Hackathon
- *Working Prototype*: Functional app with user registration, opportunity matching, patient record creation, and offline support.
- *Demo Scenario*:
  - Register a young nurse and an experienced doctor.
  - Match the nurse with a job and the doctor with a mentorship role.
  - Create and retrieve a patient record offline, then sync when online.
  - Display a basic admin dashboard.
- *Presentation*: 5-minute demo showcasing:
  - User registration and matching process.
  - Offline patient record creation and syncing.
  - Impact potential (e.g., reduced admin time, better workforce utilization).
- *Documentation*: Brief README with setup instructions and feature overview.

## Success Criteria
- *Functionality*: Core features (registration, matching, record creation, offline mode) work seamlessly in demo.
- *Usability*: Interface is intuitive, requiring <5 minutes to learn.
- *Impact*: Demonstrates clear potential to connect professionals and streamline data.
- *Innovation*: Highlights offline capability and remote volunteering options.

## Stretch Goals (if time permits)
- *Basic Video Call Mock-up*: Simulate remote mentorship with a placeholder video interface.
- *Analytics Visualization*: Simple chart (e.g., bar graph of matches or records).
- *Multi-Language Support*: Add basic Afrikaans/Xhosa translations for UI.
- *Data Import*: Mock import of patient data from a CSV file.
