## Notes
- *Prioritization*: All listed user stories are core to the Hackathon prototype, focusing on minimal but impactful functionality to demonstrate the platform’s potential.
- *Acceptance Criteria*: Each story assumes basic functionality (e.g., successful registration, data storage, or matching) and can be expanded with specific criteria (e.g., “search returns results in <2 seconds”) during development.
- *Scope Limitation*: Stories are tailored for a Hackathon MVP, avoiding complex features like video calls or advanced analytics, which are listed as stretch goals.

These user stories cover all core features from the proposed scope, ensuring clarity for Hackathon participants to develop and showcase the prototype. Let me know if you need help prioritizing, adding acceptance criteria, or refining these stories further!
