# Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Project Overview
*Title*: Hybrid Healthcare Workforce and Data Management Solution  
*Objective*: To develop an innovative, hybrid platform that connects young and experienced healthcare professionals while streamlining patient data management to improve efficiency, collaboration, and patient outcomes in South Africa’s public healthcare system.  
*Background*: South Africa’s public healthcare faces inefficiencies due to underutilized human capital (young professionals seeking opportunities, experienced doctors reluctant to travel) and poor data management (unsynchronized records, weak internet reliance), leading to reduced productivity and strained facilities.

## 2. Stakeholders
- *Primary Stakeholders*: Public healthcare facilities, nurses, doctors (young and experienced), patients.  
- *Secondary Stakeholders*: Department of Health, healthcare NGOs, technology providers.  
- *Project Sponsor*: [TBD - e.g., Department of Health or partnered NGO].  
- *End Users*: Healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, patients.

## 3. Business Objectives
- *Connect Workforce*: Facilitate engagement of young nurses/doctors and experienced doctors for employment, volunteering, and mentorship.  
- *Streamline Data Management*: Improve patient records management and hospital data synchronization.  
- *Enhance Efficiency*: Reduce repetitive administrative tasks and improve productivity.  
- *Improve Patient Outcomes*: Enable faster, more accurate care delivery through better collaboration and data access.  
- *Overcome Connectivity Barriers*: Ensure functionality in low-internet environments.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Workforce Connection Platform
- *User Profiles*: Create profiles for young professionals (nurses/doctors) and experienced doctors, including qualifications, availability, and preferences (e.g., remote vs. in-person volunteering).  
- *Matching System*: Algorithm to match young professionals with job/practical opportunities and experienced doctors with volunteering/mentorship roles based on location, skills, and needs.  
- *Communication Tools*: Secure chat, video conferencing, and scheduling for mentorship and collaboration.  
- *Location Flexibility*: Options for remote consultations or mentorship to accommodate experienced doctors’ reluctance to travel.  
- *Notifications*: Alerts for new opportunities, mentorship sessions, or volunteer requests.

### 4.2 Patient Data Management System
- *Centralized Database*: Cloud-based patient records accessible across facilities, with offline capabilities for low-connectivity areas.  
- *Data Synchronization*: Real-time or periodic syncing of patient data across hospitals/clinics when internet is available.  
- *Electronic Health Records (EHR)*: Standardized templates for patient histories, diagnoses, and treatments to reduce administrative repetition.  
- *User Access Control*: Role-based access (e.g., doctors, nurses, admins) to ensure data security and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., POPIA).  
- *Searchable Records*: Quick retrieval of patient data by ID, name, or condition.

### 4.3 System Features
- *Offline Mode*: Store and forward data when internet is unavailable, syncing automatically when connectivity resumes.  
- *Mobile Accessibility*: Mobile app for healthcare workers to access records, schedules, and communication tools.  
- *Analytics Dashboard*: Provide insights on workforce utilization, patient load, and system performance for administrators.  
- *Integration*: Compatibility with existing healthcare systems and government databases (e.g., NHLS).  
- *Scalability*: Support for expansion to additional facilities and users.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- *Performance*: System must handle 10,000 concurrent users with <2-second response time for data retrieval.  
- *Reliability*: 99.9% uptime for cloud services, with robust offline functionality.  
- *Security*: End-to-end encryption, compliance with POPIA, and regular security audits.  
- *Usability*: Intuitive interface requiring <1 hour of training for end users.  
- *Scalability*: Support up to 500 facilities and 50,000 users within 3 years.  
- *Maintenance*: Regular updates and support for bug fixes and feature enhancements.

## 6. Constraints
- *Budget*: To be defined by project sponsor; prioritize cost-effective technologies.  
- *Timeline*: Initial prototype within 6 months; full deployment within 18 months.  
- *Connectivity*: Must function in areas with intermittent or no internet.  
- *Regulatory Compliance*: Adhere to South African healthcare regulations (e.g., HPCSA, POPIA).

## 7. Assumptions
- Healthcare facilities have basic hardware (e.g., smartphones, computers) for system access.  
- Government or NGOs will support training and adoption.  
- Experienced doctors are willing to engage if travel barriers are minimized.  
- Internet connectivity will improve over time but cannot be relied upon initially.

## 8. Risks
- *Low Adoption*: Resistance from healthcare workers due to change or lack of training.  
  Mitigation: Provide comprehensive training and user-friendly design.  
- *Data Security*: Potential breaches of patient data.  
  Mitigation: Implement robust encryption and access controls.  
- *Connectivity Issues*: Persistent low/no internet in rural areas.  
  Mitigation: Prioritize offline capabilities and store-and-forward functionality.  
- *Funding*: Limited budget for development and scaling.  
  Mitigation: Seek partnerships with NGOs or private sector.

## 9. Success Criteria
- *Workforce Engagement*: 80% of young professionals find opportunities within 3 months; 50% of experienced doctors participate in volunteering/mentorship within 1 year.  
- *Data Efficiency*: 50% reduction in time spent on administrative tasks within 6 months of deployment.  
- *Patient Outcomes*: 20% improvement in patient wait times and treatment accuracy within 1 year.  
- *System Uptime*: 99.9% availability and 90% user satisfaction in usability surveys.

## 10. Implementation Considerations
- *Phased Rollout*: Pilot in 5 facilities, expand to 50 within 12 months.  
- *Training*: Provide workshops and online tutorials for users.  
- *Support*: Establish a helpdesk for technical and user support.  
- *Partnerships*: Collaborate with telecom providers for subsidized data plans and hardware providers for affordable devices.

## 11. Approval
*Prepared By*: [Your Name/Role, e.g., Project Analyst]  
*Date*: September 26, 2025  
*Approval*: [TBD - Project Sponsor/Department of Health Representative]
